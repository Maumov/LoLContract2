    "intro_2": "Finally I can get out of this place, I just have to defeat the 12 guardians and I will be free.",
	"intro_3": "I have to move with the keyboard to the doors and press 'Space' to open them.",
	"intro_4": "That way I will defeat the guardian and get out of this castle.",

	"tutorial1_1": "Since there are 2 portions of 1/2 in 1 unit then there must be 3 times 2 portions in 3 units.",
	"tutorial1_2": "So 3 divided by 1/2 = 3 x 2 = 6",
	"tutorial3_1": "Since 3 divided by 1/2 = 6, then 6 times 1/2 must be equal to 3",
	"tutorial4_1": "Since I am dividing a whole number number by a fraction (4 divided by 2/3). I can turn the whole number into a fraction (4/1)",
	"tutorial4_2": "Now that I have a division of fractions. I can solve it by doing a cross multiplication.",
	"tutorial5_1": "Dividing a unit fraction(1/3) into more whole number parts(4) means partitioning the denominator into smaller parts.",
	"tutorial5_2": "So I will have 1/3 times 1/4 and that will be 1/12.",
	"tutorial7_1": "4/2 is equal to 2.",
	"tutorial7_2": "Now if I am looking for an equivalent fraction (8/4).",
	"tutorial7_3": "This equivalent fraction 8/4 is equal to 2.",
	"tutorial7_4": "That means that finding the equivalent fractions with common denominators does not change the value of either fraction.",
	"tutorial8_1": "To add this fraction with unlike denominator, I must find a equivalent fraction with the same denominator.",
	"tutorial8_2": "To do that I will multiply 1/2 by 5, the denominator of the fraction beside (1/2 x 5/5)",
	"tutorial8_3": "Then I will do the same with 3/5 but this time I will multiply it by 2 (3/5 x 2/2)",
	"tutorial8_4": "Now we solve the first equivalent fraction's multiplication 1/2 x 5/5 = 5/10.",
	"tutorial8_5": "The second equivalent fraction's multiplication is 3/5 x 2/2, thats equal to 6/10.",
	"tutorial8_6": "Then we add the first value (5/10) to the second one (6/10) thats equal to 11/10.",
	"tutorial8_7": "Finally we can see the that if we solve 1/2 + 3/5 = 11/10. I solve it finding an equivalent fraction with the same denominator.",
	"tutorial9_1": "To do a multiplication we have to multiply numerator by numerator and denominator by denominator.",
	"tutorial9_2": "2 times 4 equals to 8, and 5 times 3 equals to 15.",
